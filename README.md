# Sniffybara

Effortlessly sniff your web application for accessibility issues!  

Sniffybara is a modified Selenium driver for [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) that scans for 508 accessibility compliance between steps. It uses the [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility scanner to perform accessibility checks.

## Installation

Sniffybara is not hosted in RubyGems.org right now. In the meantime, import it via git by adding the following file to your `Gemfile`

```
gem 'sniffybara', git: 'https://github.com:department-of-veterans-affairs/sniffybara.git'
```

Then install the gems:

> $ bundle install

By default, Sniffybara uses Chrome, which will require you to install the Selenium chromedriver

> $ brew install chromedriver

Then, for any files you'd like to be checked for accessibility add the following lines to the top of that file.

```ruby
require "capybara"
Capybara.default_driver = :sniffybara
```

## Configuration

It is recommended that you use the run_configuration_file to pass in options for Axe.run() following the format specified in the [Axe API](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/72f0187dc8f534788fc0eb99a9ce48cd42a7923a/doc/API.md#options-parameter)

If you want any accessibility errors to not raise an error, just add them to the exceptions:

```ruby
Sniffybara::Driver.accessibility_code_exceptions << "WCAG2AA.Principle1.Guideline1_3.1_3_1.F68"
```

If you want to completely omit a page from accessibility testing, set the `path_exclusions` option:

```ruby
Sniffybara::Driver.path_exclusions << /pattern-to-omit/
```
